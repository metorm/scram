/// Undo-redo helper facilities based on the Qt Undo framework.
///
/// Undo-redo facilities assume the following contract:
///
/// 0. The facilities are special purpose to work with the undo-redo stack.
/// 1. The redo is always called first.
/// 2. The undo-redo functions are not required to be idempotent.
///    Calling the redo (or undo) consecutively yields undefined behavior.
///    In other words, the redo can only be followed by the undo,
///    and the undo can only be followed by the redo.
/// 3. The system state is only changed with the undo-redo facilities.
/// 4. As a consequence of contract #2 and #3,
///    the implementation can and should optimize the state storage
///    to hold only single snapshot data (no duplication of the state).
///    That is, the redo stage saves the past (by overwriting the future),
///    and the undo stage saves the future by overwriting the saved past.
/// 5. Objects (undo-redo arguments) must be alive and have stable addresses for
///    at least as long as there's a referencing undo-redo command in the stack.
///    Constructive/destructive commands extend
///    the life-time of an object for this reason.
///    That is, destructive commands do not destroy/deallocate at redo
///    or re-construct/allocate at undo (vice-versa for the constructive).
///    The object is destroyed/deallocated
///    after its corresponding constructive/destructive commands are destroyed
///    (e.g., by being popped/removed from the undo stack).
